## desclaimer 

This website serves as a showcase for my portfolio and a platform to test and demonstrate my development skills. It is a clone website inspired by the elegant design of https://grovemade.com/. I was captivated by their design, and I embarked on the challenge of replicating it for my own website. It's important to note that this project is solely for personal development and skill enhancement, and I do not generate any revenue from it. Its primary purpose is to exhibit my abilities as a developer and showcase my passion for creating visually appealing and functional websites.
